# Y8-CAT-Inv1-Lucas-Wan


Part 1:
To achieve translations on the Cartesian plane according to the specified directions and distances, we can create a reusable function that utilizes a lookup table approach.

1. Lookup Table Creation: We will create a lookup table that maps each direction (1 to 8) to the corresponding Pythagorean triple (a, b, c). This table will help us quickly determine the appropriate translation for each direction.
2. Translation Function: We'll design a function that takes the desired distance and direction as inputs. Using the lookup table, it will identify the corresponding Pythagorean triple and calculate the translation vector accordingly.
3. Error Handling: We'll include error handling to ensure that the input direction is within the valid range (1 to 8) and that the distance is non-negative.
4. Documentation: We'll thoroughly document the function's purpose, inputs, outputs, and usage to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.
